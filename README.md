# ShopGun JavaScript SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shopgun/shopgun-js-sdk.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/shopgun/shopgun-js-sdk)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/shopgun-sdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/shopgun-sdk)

This SDK works both client-side in your browser but also server-side in a Node.js environment.

## Creating an App

First, you need to [create a ShopGun app](https://shopgun.com/developers/apps) allowing you to make API requests. You will be prompted to create a new user first.

> We recommend creating 2 apps: 1 for production and another for development. This ensures environments aren't mixed.

## Setup

### In the Browser

The SDK makes use of both JavaScript and CSS so you need to load two resources in the browser:

```html
<link
  href="https://d21oefkcnoen8i.cloudfront.net/sgn-sdk-2.3.14.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
/>
<script
  src="https://d21oefkcnoen8i.cloudfront.net/sgn-sdk-2.3.14.min.js"
  id="sgn-sdk"
  data-app-key="YOUR_APP_KEY"
  data-track-id="YOUR_TRACK_ID"
></script>
```

By defining your app key and track identifier as data attributes when including the JavaScript file the SDK auto-configures itself. You can find the app key and track identifier in the [developer console](https://shopgun.com/developers/apps).

### In Node.js

We recommend you use npm to install the SDK. To install, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install shopgun-sdk
```

When installed you can require and configure the SDK:

```javascript
SGN = require('sgn-sdk');

SGN.config.set({
  appKey: 'YOUR_APP_KEY',
  appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET'
});
```

We recommend using environment variables for the config to avoid having secrets in your code base:

```javascript
SGN.config.set({
  appKey: process.env.SHOPGUN_APP_KEY,
  appSecret: process.env.SHOPGUN_APP_SECRET
});
```

## Paged Publications

To provide your users with a viewing experience for PDF's you need to use our PagedPublicationKit. We've built an [example](https://shopgun.github.io/shopgun-js-sdk/paged-publication.html) that shows how it can work.

## More Platforms
